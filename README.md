Deep learning (DL) models face significant challenges in medical diagnostics due to the scarcity of extensive datasets, particularly for rare diseases. The DL community frequently resorts to data augmentation and synthetic data generation to circumvent this limitation. However, the production of synthetic medical data has ethical and privacy concerns. In response to these challenges, we introduce CAT-U-Net, an innovative adaptation of the traditional U-Net architecture with additional concatenation layers, which emerges as a solution, enhancing the model’s feature extraction capabilities from medical imaging without needing large data volumes. This approach overcomes synthetic data generation’s ethical and privacy concerns, offering a novel pathway to improve diagnostic accuracy. Tested across diverse conditions—COVID-19, brain tumors, and bone fractures—CAT-U-Net demonstrated remarkable adaptability and robustness, achieving nearly 98% reconstruction accuracy and a Dice coefficient close to 0.946. By integrating thresholding techniques for precise binary segmentation and employing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimized learning, CAT-U-Net showcases the potential to significantly advance medical image diagnostics in data-constrained environments, heralding a new era of efficiency and precision in the application of DL technologies in healthcare. When the DL community faces the challenge of diagnosing rare diseases, they often need help with limited datasets. Our research focuses on demonstrating how deep learning can achieve the highest diagnostic accuracy despite these constraints. The CAT-U-Net model is designed to operate effectively with limited data, ensuring high precision in medical image analysis without relying on extensive datasets.

The U.S. healthcare industry will benefit greatly from this research as it provides a robust method for accurate diagnosis in limited data, such as rare diseases. By improving diagnostic accuracy, CAT-U-Net can lead to earlier and more precise detection of medical conditions, improving patient outcomes. Moreover, avoiding synthetic data generation mitigates ethical and privacy concerns, aligns with stringent healthcare data regulations, and enhances trust in AI-driven diagnostics. This innovation supports healthcare providers by ensuring reliable diagnostic tools are available even in data-constrained environments, ultimately contributing to more effective and timely patient care.
